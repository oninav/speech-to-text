    "text": "Speech-to-Text Conversion\nTechniques, Tools, and Trade-offs\nOmkar Ninav\nJune 30, 2025\n\nGood [morning/afternoon], thank you for taking the time to attend this presentation.\nThe goal today is to give a structured and technical overview of speech-to-text conversion — how it works, what tools and models are currently leading the field, and what trade-offs are involved in choosing a particular solution.\nThis is a technology that’s become foundational in a wide range of domains — from customer support and assistive tech, to real-time captioning and voice interfaces. I’ll be focusing on how Python-based tools like Whisper, Wav2Vec2, and others can be used to build robust STT systems.\nBy the end, I hope to outline clearly: - How the core pipeline functions, - Which models are best suited for various use cases, and - What the cost and accuracy implications are — especially in terms of practical deployment.\nLet’s begin with the basics."

This module transforms the raw waveform into meaningful patterns — usually through methods like MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) or spectrograms.\nNext, the acoustic model interprets these features and maps them to likely phonemes or character sequences. Traditionally, these were HMM-based, but today they’re often deep neural networks like CNNs, RNNs, or transformers.\nThe language model plays a critical role — it uses linguistic context to predict the most likely word sequences. This is what helps the system understand the difference between similar-sounding phrases like “ice cream” vs “I scream.”\nFinally, the decoder combines all of this — the acoustic predictions and the language probabilities — to produce the final transcription.\nUnderstanding this pipeline helps clarify where different models and libraries fit in, and what we can tweak based on accuracy, speed, or deployment constraints."

HMMs model the sequential nature of speech, and GMMs handle the probability distributions of acoustic features within each state.\nFor predicting the next word or phrase, systems used n-gram language models — for example, a trigram model would look at the two previous words to estimate the next one. These models were easy to implement but had limited ability to understand context or long-term dependencies.\nThe front end of these systems used MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) to convert audio waveforms into feature vectors that captured the shape and tone of the speech signal. MFCCs remain popular even in some deep learning systems due to their compact and informative representation of sound.\nWhile these traditional methods laid the foundation for modern ASR, they struggled with complex variations like accents, overlapping speakers, and noisy environments."

Then came Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to handle time-frequency patterns in audio. Today, transformers are dominant due to their superior performance in modeling long-range dependencies and context.\nInstead of breaking the process into multiple modules like traditional ASR, deep learning systems often use end-to-end models. These can be trained to map directly from raw audio to text using techniques like Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) or attention-based models.\nRecent trends in STT are pushing the field even further: - Self-supervised learning enables models like Wav2Vec 2.0 to learn from raw, unlabeled audio — drastically reducing the need for costly transcriptions. - Models like Whisper offer multilingual support and are robust to accents and background noise. - There’s also growing interest in on-device inference, where models are small and efficient enough to run on phones, edge devices, or embedded systems — ensuring both privacy and speed.\nThese modern techniques make STT more accurate, scalable, and accessible than ever before."

It does require a decent GPU to run efficiently, especially for long audio files or real-time use, but it’s very accessible for developers and teams with modest resources.\nWav2Vec 2.0 is another excellent option. It provides high accuracy, especially when fine-tuned on domain-specific data. However, it’s primarily trained on English datasets, so multilingual support is more limited unless you retrain it. It’s open-source and can be accessed via Hugging Face.\nGoogle Speech-to-Text API is a commercial solution. It offers very high accuracy and supports over 100 languages. It’s excellent for real-time use cases and scales easily. However, it’s not free — the cost is around $1.44 per hour, and it requires internet connectivity, which may raise privacy concerns in sensitive environments.\nDeepSpeech was designed to be lightweight and fast, making it suitable for edge devices. That said, it has started to lag behind in terms of accuracy, especially on noisy or accented inputs, and its development has slowed down in recent years.\nKaldi is extremely powerful and flexible. It’s used in many academic and enterprise applications where low-level control is needed — for instance, custom language models, speaker adaptation, and complex pipelines. However, it’s not beginner-friendly, and the learning curve is steep. PyKaldi can help if you want to work with it in Python.\nVosk is surprisingly effective given its small size. It offers decent accuracy, real-time performance, works fully offline, and is extremely easy to integrate — especially on embedded systems or mobile platforms.For projects targeting Indian languages or edge devices, Vosk can be a better fit than Whisper or cloud APIs.\nThis slide helps us decide which model might be most appropriate depending on our project constraints — whether we prioritize cost, offline access, multilingual support, or ease of use.\nIn the next slide, we’ll break down the cost aspect more specifically, including free tiers and usage pricing for cloud APIs."
